    <h3><em>About Me</em></h3>
  <div class="my-class">
    <p>After graduating high school, I went to <span> college of the Siskiyou’s </span>for 1 year.  I then transferred schools to <span> Central Oregon Community College</span> for another year. I studied abroad in Spain for a term as well.  I jumped into a sales position for a smaller telecommunications company, where I spent the next 6 years.  During this time I moved into a sales manager role.  I decided to change my career path, and took a job in the oil field in the Alaska.  I spent the next 6 years in the oil field.  I started as a general maintenance tech, then moved into a equipment operator position.  I finished up my employment there as a lead where I ran a crew of 4-10 people on daily projects. I now turned to Epicodus to build my skill set into coding.  I have always like to keep a balance of field work and technology.  While I enjoyed my last 6 years in the Arctic ocean, I am excited to start a new career path in coding(also will enjoy some warmer weather.)  Living in Portland, I have enjoyed going out to many fantastic restaurant’s.  I love going out to blazer or winter Hawks games, or just watching sports in general. I spend a lot of my free time taking trips with the wife or I will be out playing on the golf course.</p>
